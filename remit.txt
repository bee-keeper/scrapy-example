 Simple Python Crawler.

o Write a simple single threaded crawler capable of taking a single seed and
collecting all content on a domain into files on disk.
o Performance and scaling does not need to be addressed - being able to the code.

o The use of third party libraries for HTML parsing is fine.

o The code should be written in Python and it should run on a basic Linux
machine with instructions for additional libraries that need installing.
